# Endless Sky

Explore other star systems. Earn money by trading, carrying passengers, or completing missions. Use your earnings to buy a better ship or to upgrade the weapons and engines on your current one. Blow up pirates. Take sides in a civil war. Or leave human space behind and hope to find some friendly aliens whose culture is more civilized than your own...

------

Endless Sky is a sandbox-style space exploration game similar to Elite, Escape Velocity, or Star Control. You start out as the captain of a tiny spaceship and can choose what to do from there. The game includes a major plot line and many minor missions, but you can choose whether you want to play through the plot or strike out on your own as a merchant or bounty hunter or explorer.

See the [player's manual](https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky/wiki/PlayersManual) for more information, or the [home page](https://endless-sky.github.io/) for screenshots and the occasional blog post.

# neoe changes

显然，ES不是一个无脑射击的游戏。因为我才玩就发现台词是有文采的，读起来也很有意思。前提是你的英语
必须要达到8级以上。我已经放弃了精通外语的野心。

所以第一个修改点是把台词输出到log文件里，然后手工用我刚发现的翻译质量不错的 https://www.deepl.com/translator 来翻译一下。

下一个也许是汉化，有前人做了少量的工作。首先我要玩一下是否好玩。只有对自己来说好玩的游戏才会去汉化的。
