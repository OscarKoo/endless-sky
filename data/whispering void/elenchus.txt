		description `在过去的一个世纪里，这个月球有一立方公里被挖空了，充满了走廊和空洞的房间。这里有一个近十万人的城市，自从他们的祖先在一百二十年前第一次被带到这里，他们的生活就一直以科学为中心。现在，人类、海族，甚至一些Korath，都在这里并肩工作。他们曾经是一连串犯罪组织的奴隶，他们的故事把海族和人类带到了战争的边缘。幸运的是，一位来自新波士顿的足智多谋的飞行员避免了灾难的发生，解放了Elenctic Commune。`
		spaceport `太空港是一个独立的结构，与较大的地下定居点分开。它有机库和通往地面的通风通道，有一个巨大的空气处理器，是人口呼吸空气的主要供应地。这曾经让这个城市被海盗集团控制，尽管他们的人数远远超过他们的统治者。一个废弃的格斗场、放置战斗战利品的空坐骑，以及曾经关押海盗受害者的血腥钉子，都仍然是建筑中烘托的特征。一条厚厚的通道，加上辅助走廊和通风口，从太空港向下通往主要定居点。入侵造成的损失仍然很大，但居民们正在慢慢清理。`
